We based front end for infrastructure design on any cloud

## TODO

Create a web-based frontend with canvas (maybe html5) and a left pane having objects.
Objects from the left pane of the web page can be dragged and dropped to the canvas.
A cloud architecture diagram can be created using this frontend.
Upon click of a button, a custom code should be generated in the background based on the design on the canvas.
There should be options to generate the code for OpenStack heat, aws cloud formation template, etc.
